Sometimes "#NoSimplerr#" just doesn't cut it.
This thing really helps if you're making a fresh DarkRP server, and you want to modify jobs and stuff on the fly without having to restart every lua refresh.
Hot-loading new jobs, categories, etc. seems to work fine, but consider reloading the gamemode if you backtrack your work often.

[STEPS]
1. Downloading provides a compressed "DarkRP-Without-Simplerr" folder.
2. Extract the "darkrp" folder from it.
3. Place the "darkrp" folder in the server gamemodes directory.
4. Make sure the official version of DarkRP isn't in your server/personal Workshop collection, obviously.

This is really only intended to be used for local development and not for a *live* server. If you insist, you'll want to handle sending the gamemode content (textures and alike) to your players, since you won't be using the Workshop version.
You should continue using the officical darkrpmodification addon while using this.
